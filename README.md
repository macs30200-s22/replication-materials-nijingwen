#### RQ: How covid19 impacts on unemployment rate of provinces in China?
#### Hypothesis: Covid19 will promote umemployment rate of provinces in 2020
#### Data source: 
1. National Bureau of Statistics: http://www.stats.gov.cn/ : scraping
2. Harvard: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MR5IJN : download csv
                 

#### Introduction:
The goal of the project is to figure out the impact of covid 19 on unemployment rate each province in China. The hypothesis is Covid19 will promote umemployment rate of provinces in 2020. I will use GDP to measure development level, CPI to measure price level, the graduation number university, and the college (Note: college is for students who failed entered the university in China) to measure education level, the death rate and born rate to measure the change of provinceâ€™s population and residence population, the increase income of first industry, the increase income of second industry, the increase income of third industry as control variables. To measure the impact of covid19, I will use the number of covid19 confirmed, the number of deaths, the number of recoveries of each province in 2020 to as my dependent variable.

Note: Here are three sections in my data visualize part. They are seperately with data preprocessing and combined into analysis

The code is written in Python 3.9.7 and all of its dependencies can be installed by running the following in the terminal (with the requirements.txt file included in this repository):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Preprocessing data: Run Data Preprocessing of MACS30200_finalproject.ipynb
1. Check and drop NA: No NA Value
2. Feature selection: draw heatmap of correlation with seaborns 
3. data scaling: scale features to avoid bias
4. combine the column name with scaled array of features with dictionary

#### Model: Linear Regression
1. Firstly, I use the data of control varibles and unemployment rate from 2008 to 2019 to train and test the regression model and get model.score around 0.88. 
2. Secondly, I plot the data of control variables in 2020 in to the regression model and predict the unemployment rate in 2020 if there is no covid by utilizing model.predict 
3. Thirdly, I use the predicted unemployment and true unemployment rate in 2020 to figure out the gap. 
4. Lastly, I plot all data in 2020 with covid related features into the regression to see the P value and feature importance


#### Initial Outcome: Consistent with Hypothesis

##### 1: The covid has positive relation with the gap_value. More covid will lead to larger predicted gap between true value and predicted value.

##### 2: Fujian Province has the least gap between predicted unemployment rate while Henan has the largest gap. I will pick these two province for specific analysis

##### 3: Through the OLS regression for gap_value summary, the p value of deaths and recovery is smaller than 0.05 which is bigger than 0.05.

##### 4: Through the OLS regression for unemployment summary, the p value of deaths is 0.063 and recovery is 0.063, confirmed is 0.348 which are all bigger than 0.05. Reject the hypothesis.
